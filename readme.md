# Woodbadge meal assignments

## Introduction

Woodbadge staff are assigned to eat with patrols following the rules
below.  Generally, we like to prevent a particular staff member
from eating with the same patrol more than once in a weekend.
There are some special individual rules.  

A general observation is that a good portion of the assignments are
predetermined.  So we use that and just fill in the parts that can
truly be random.  

The 'other staff eat with own critter in week 1'
is also somewhat predetermined.  The clever design technique used
is to sort the staff needing to be assigned by critter, then go through
each meal (wrapping as needed) needing assignment and put the next staff
in that meal.  This gives a nice distribution.

Random number assignment does not seem to work.  Just iterate through one
by one patrols.  This should be the plan is the same over different
runs.
